# esp32-robot-car-webserver
wired a robot car with the esp32 as the micro controller. car had 2 l298ns controlling 2 motors each. 2 li ion batteries powered the two l298ns and 2 li ion batteries powered the esp32. I hosted a webserver through wifi on the esp32 which had buttons for left right forward and backwards and a speed gauge to control car speed.
